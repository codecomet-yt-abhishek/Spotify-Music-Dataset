# Spotify-Music-Dataset
The dataset is collated from Spotify's API using two separate python scripts to extract popular and non-popular songs and their associated audio and descriptive features. Descriptive features of a song include information about the song such as the artist name, album name and release date. Audio features include key, valence , danceability and energy which are results of spotify's audio analysis. The combined features used in the experimentation phase of this project include:
